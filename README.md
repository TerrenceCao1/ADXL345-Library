Hello!

This is a sensor driver designed for the Arduino Ecosystem. It's tested on the atmega328 (which is the chip on the Uno and the Nano)

It's very lightweight, with the simple functionality of writing setting the parameters for the sensor, as well as reading data from the sensor, Y'all can use it for whatever you want I really don't care.

**CURRENTLY UNFINISHED USE SOMEONE ELSE'S**
