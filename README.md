### ADXL345 Accelerometer Driver!

Hello!

This is a sensor driver designed for the Arduino Ecosystem. It's tested on the atmega328 (which is the chip on the Uno and the Nano) and ESP32. 

It's very lightweight, with the simple functionality of writing setting the parameters for the sensor, calibrating, and as reading data from the sensor, Y'all can use it for whatever you want I really don't care.

Read the examples, I think it's fairly simple to use. Thanks for checking this out :D
